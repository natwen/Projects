# Projects

1. The self-driving car project was my first ever project, which I completed three years ago. Initially, I coded the car directly on Arduino. Later, I transitioned to using a module to code in Python, which I found more comfortable. The 'code_voiture_python.py' segment comprises the code that controls the car's behavior. The 'labyrinthe.py' section simulates the shortest path through a maze, employing various functions to optimize the route. Lastly, the 'modelisation_voiture.py' segment simulates the actual movement of the car, replicating its behavior accurately.
