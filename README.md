# Projects
I've organized my most significant projects into different branches within this repository:

1. Main Branch: Contains a Space Invader game I developed using Python and Object-Oriented Programming principles.
2. CSPC Branch: Includes exercises I completed using concurrent programming concepts.
3. Self-Driving-Car Branch: Features my inaugural coding projectâ€”a self-driving car programmed to navigate its way out of a maze.
